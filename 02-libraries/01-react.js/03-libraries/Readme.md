- Installation
  ```sh
    npm install--save-dev react-test-renderer
    yarn add--dev react-test-renderer
  ```

# 10. Storybook

- It is a tool that tests React components in an isolated environment. It makes the component development and testing process more efficient. You can use it to test different user interface states and visualize the functionality of components.
- Installation
  ```sh
    npm install @storybook/react
    yarn add @storybook/react
  ```

# 11. React i18next

- It is used to develop multilingual applications in React projects. It works integrated with i18next and facilitates **language changing** operations. Dynamic language changing operations can be easily done.

    npm install react-i18next
    yarn add i18next-react
  ```

# 12. Redux Toolkit

- **Redux Toolkit** is a tool that makes global state management in React projects easier and more efficient. It helps you manage data flow within the application by simplifying the complex structures of Redux. It offers a clear structure for data management and data updates even in large and complex projects. It is also used with Redux DevTools, which offers advanced debugging and time-travel debugging features.
- Installation
  ```sh
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
    yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
  ```

# 13. Zustand

- **Zustand** is a tool that makes **global state management** in React projects easier and more efficient. It offers a clear structure for data management and data updates even in large and complex projects.
