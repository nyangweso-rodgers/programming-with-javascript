# Layouts of `Next.js`

- A **layout** is UI that is shared between routes.
- A **root layout** is the top-most layout in the root `app` directory. It is used to define the `<html>` and `<body>` tags and other globally shared UI.

  ```javascript
  //layout.js
  import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
  import "./globals.css";

  const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

  export const metadata = {
    title: "Next.js Template App",
    description: "Generated by create next app",
  };

  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

# `props`

## `children`

- Layout components should accept and use a `children` prop. During rendering, `children` will be populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping. These will primarily be the component of a child Layout (if it exists) or Page, but could also be other special files like Loading or Error when applicable.
- **Layouts** are used to create a consistent design across an a application. We can use **layouts** to include common elements such as a **header**, and **footer**, on every page of the application.
