# Library vs. Frameworks

- A **library** and a **framework** are similar in that they are both _collections of pre-written code that can be used to add functionality to a software application_. However, there are some key differences between the two:

- A **library** is a _collection of functions that can be called by the application to perform specific tasks_. The application is responsible for controlling the flow of the program, and the library provides specific functionality that can be used as needed.

- A **framework**, on the other hand, is a more opinionated and prescriptive approach to building applications. A _framework provides a structure and set of conventions for building an application, and the application is built within the constraints and guidelines provided by the framework_. The framework controls the flow of the program and the application provides the specific implementation details.

- In the context of `Angular` and `React`, **Angular** is a framework, while `React` is a library. `Angular` provides a complete solution for building web applications, including a structure for organizing and building the application, as well as a set of conventions and tools for handling tasks such as state management and server communication. `React`, on the other hand, provides a set of components and functions that can be used to build a user interface, but it is up to the developer to choose how to handle other aspects of the application.
