// do -- while loop

var d = 1;

    do {
        console.log(d + "<br/>");
        d++;
    }
    while (d <= 10); // this prints out numbers from 20 to 25
    // the loop will always be executed at least  once, even if the condition is false, ..............because the code block is executed  before the condition is tested
