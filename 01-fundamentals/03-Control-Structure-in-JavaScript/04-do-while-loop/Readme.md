# `do --- while` loop in `js`

# `do..while` loop

- the `do..while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. this loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is `true` and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is `true`.

  ```js
  // syntax
  do {
    // code block
  } while (condition);
  ```

# Task 1: Print numbers between 1 and 10 using a `do while` loop

```js
var d = 1;

do {
  console.log(d + "<br/>");
  d++;
} while (d <= 10); // this prints out numbers from 20 to 25
// the loop will always be executed at least  once, even if the condition is false, ..............because the code block is executed  before the condition is tested
```
