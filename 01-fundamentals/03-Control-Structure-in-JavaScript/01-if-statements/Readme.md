# `if else statements` Description

- `if` statements are used to specify a block of code that will be executed if a specified condition is `true`:

  ```js
  // this statement will be executed only if a specified conditin is true
  if (condition) {
    statements;
  }
  ```

- you can use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is `FALSE`

# Examples

## Task 1: Compare two numbers with an `if` statement

```js
var a = 7;
var b = 10;

if (a < b) {
  console.log("JS is starting to get easier");
}
```

## Task 2: Compare two numbers with an `if else` statement

```js
// else statement
var a = 7;
var b = 10;

if (a > b) {
  console.log("A is greater than B");
} else {
  console.log("A is less than B");
} // A is less than B
```

## Task 3: Compare two numbers using `?` Operator

```js
// using ? operator
var a = 7;
var b = 10;
a > b ? console.log("A is greater than B") : console.log("Not Allowed!"); // Not Allowed
```

## Task 4: Use `else if` statement

```js
// else if statement
var dayOfWeek = "Monday";

if (dayOfWeek == "Monday") {
  console.log(`Today is ${dayOfWeek}, we are eating Pizza and Soda`);
} else if (dayOfWeek == "Tuesday") {
  console.log(`Today is ${dayOfWeek}, we are eating Ugali and Kales`);
} else {
  console.log("Day is not specififed");
  // THE FINAL else block will be executed when none of the conditions is true
}
```
