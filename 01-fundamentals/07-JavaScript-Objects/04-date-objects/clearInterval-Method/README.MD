# `clearInterval()` Method

# Description
* The `clearInterval()` method is used to stop the repeated execution of a `function` that was previously started using the `setInterval()` method.
* It clears the interval timer identified by the `interval ID` that was returned when calling `setInterval()`.

# Syntax
```javascript
    // syntax 
    clearInterval(intervalID);
```

* `intervalID` represents the unique identifier of the `interval timer` to be cleared. It is the value returned by the `setInterval()` function when it was initially called.
