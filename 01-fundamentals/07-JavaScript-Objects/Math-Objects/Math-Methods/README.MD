# `Math` Object Methods

# Number to Integer
* There are 4 common methods to round a number to an integer:
    1. `Math.round(x)` - Returns x rounded to its nearest integer
    2. `Math.ceil(x)` - Returns x rounded up to its nearest integer
    3. `Math.floor(x)` - Returns x rounded down to its nearest integer
    4. `Math.trunc(x)` - Returns the integer part of x (new in ES6)

* Other methods:
    1. `Math.sign(x)` returns if x is negative, null or positive:
    2. `Math.pow(x, y)` returns the value of x to the power of y:
    3. `Math.sqrt(x)` returns the square root of x:
    4. `Math.abs(x)` returns the absolute (positive) value of x:
    5. `Math.sin(x)` returns the sine (a value between -1 and 1) of the angle x (given in radians). 
       1. If you want to use degrees instead of radians, you have to convert degrees to radians: 
       2. Angle in radians = Angle in degrees x PI / 180.
    6. `Math.cos(x)` returns the `cosine` (a value between -1 and 1) of the angle x (given in radians).
       1. If you want to use degrees instead of radians, you have to convert degrees to radians:
       2. Angle in radians = Angle in degrees x PI / 180.

    7. `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` can be used to find the lowest or highest value in a list of arguments:
    8. `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive):
    9. `Math.log(x)` returns the natural logarithm of x. _The natural logarithm returns the time needed to reach a certain level of growth:_
    10. `Math.log2(x) `returns the base 2 logarithm of x.
    11. `Math.log10(x)` returns the base 10 logarithm of x.
