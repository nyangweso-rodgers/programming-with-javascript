# Introduction to Arithmetic operations

- In `JavaScript`, the terms "**Math operators**" and "**Arithmetic operators**" are often used interchangeably because arithmetic operations are part of the broader category of mathematical operations. The term "arithmetic operators" specifically refers to operators that perform basic mathematical calculations.
- In JavaScript, common arithmetic operators include:
  - addition (`+`)
  - subtraction ( `-` )
  - multiplication ( `*`)
  - division (`/`)
  - modulo (`%`)

# 1. Remainder (Modulo)

- **Remainder**, `%`: the result of `a % b` is the remainder of `integer` division of a and b.
- Examples:
  ```js
  console.log(4 % 3); // Outut: 1
  ```

# 2. Exponentiation

- **Exponentiation** `**`: exponentiation is a recent addition to the language.
- Examples:
  ```js
  console.log(4 ** 2); // Output: 16
  ```
