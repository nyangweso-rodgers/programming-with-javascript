# Math Operators

- when people refer to "**Math operators**" in JavaScript, they might also be referring to the `Math` object, which provides a set of properties and methods for more advanced mathematical operations. For example:

  ```js
  var squareRoot = Math.sqrt(16); // squareRoot is 4
  var randomValue = Math.random(); // randomValue is a random number between 0 and 1
  ```
